 HOW TO CREATE A VM ON AWS 
 What is a virtual machine?
A virtual machine (VM) is a software demonstration and development model that simulates an operating system and its applications. VMs create a software simulation environment for testing software and application programs without physical hardware investment.
A virtual machine mimics the different aspects of an operating system or application program with guest operating systems hosted on it. These guest systems can be different architectures (e.g., x86 host and ARM guest) or different versions (e.g., 32-bit Windows XP, hosted within 64-bit Windows 7).
Properties of a virtual machine
Because a virtual machine allows you to use apps and operating systems without physical setup, itâ€™s a great improvement over traditional computing technology. The common properties of a VM are:
Quick operations: Share system resources and run multiple operating systems instantly
Hardware independence: Setup or migrate to any virtual machine or real server
End-to-end isolation: Improve performance and security with advanced resource contr

HOW TO REDUCE COST

Identify Amazon EC2 instances with low-utilization and reduce cost by stopping or rightsizing

Identify Amazon EBS volumes with low-utilization and reduce cost by snapshotting then deleting them

Analyze Amazon S3 usage and reduce cost by leveraging lower cost storage tiers

Identify Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift instances with low utilization and reduce cost by stopping (RDS) and pausing (Redshift)
